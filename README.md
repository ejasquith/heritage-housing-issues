## Dataset Content
* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace. 
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirements
As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.


## Hypotheses and Validation Techniques
* Hypothesis 1: Lot area, overall quality, and remodel date are strongly, positively correlated with sale price.
    * This can be tested using a correlation study.
* Hypothesis 2: Sale price against year built will follow a bimodal distribution, with higher sale prices for very old and very new properties.
    * This can be tested by plotting sale price against age.
* Hypothesis 3: Lot area and overall quality are the strongest predictor features for the target.
    * This can be tested using a correlation study.


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks
* Business requirement 1: Data Visualisation and Correlation Study
    * We will explore the housing data.
    * We will conduct correlation (Pearson & Spearman) studies and predictive power studies to understand how each feature relates to the target (sale price).
    * We will plot all relevant features against the target.
* Business requirement 2: Regression Pipeline
    * We will build a regressor model to predict house sale price based on relevant features.


## ML Business Case
### Predict Sale Price
* We want to create a ML model to predict the sale price of a house based on historical values.
* The target variable (sale price) is a continuous numerical variable; therefore, we consider a regression model first and foremost.
* The model will provide value to the client by giving insight into current property holdings, as well as future investments.
* Input data will be provided by the client, either on the fly or in batches collated in .csv files. Initially the client will want to predict the sale price of their 4 inherited properties, but more predictions may be made as the client considers more investment opportunities.
* The model's success metric has been defined as:
    * An R2 score of 0.75 on train and test sets.


## Dashboard Design
### Page 1: Project Summary
* Overview of project details, terms, jargon etc
* Description of the dataset
* Business requirements

### Page 2: Data Analysis
* Reiterate business requirement 1
* Display shape of dataset (no. rows and columns) and first 10 entries.
* Display correlation plots between features and target
* Describe most correlated features and plot against target
    * This could be done with scatter plots, line plots, etc
* All features should be toggleable with a checkbox or similar

### Page 3: Predict Sale Price
* Reiterate business requiment 2
* Displays the details of each inherited property and their predicted sale price
* Display the summed total of sale prices for the properties
* Inputs allowing user to enter house details manually, or upload a csv containing multiple records
* 'Run Analysis' button that feeds data into the ML pipeline and displays the prediction of sale price for each

### Page 4: Project Hypotheses & Validation
* Display all hypotheses, conclusions, and validation methods

### Page 5: Regressor Model Analysis
* Present all steps in the ML pipeline
* Considerations after pipeline is trained
* Discuss feature importances
* Analyse pipeline performance and discuss limitations



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.
